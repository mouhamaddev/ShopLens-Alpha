# ShopLens-Alpha

ShopLens-Alpha is an image search engine and shopping API tool that allows users to search for products using their camera. This repository combines two approaches to find products: image comparison and image labeling/tagging.

## Introduction

ShopLens-Alpha is designed to simplify product searching for users. It leverages machine learning techniques to compare images and transform them into labels and tags for efficient product discovery. This README will guide you through using this repository and understanding the project's architecture.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can use this repository as a template by clicking the "Use this template" button [here](https://github.com/mouhamaddev/ShopLens-Alpha/generate). If you prefer not to use GitHub, you can simply clone this repository.

## Project Structure

1. `project/`: Rename this folder to your project name and customize references accordingly.
2. `tests/`: Contains test cases for the project. You can run tests using `pytest`.
3. `setup.py`: Modify this file with your project's information for packaging.
4. `README.md`: You're reading it right now! It's your project's documentation.

## Model Architecture

The ShopLens-Alpha project incorporates two main models for its image search engine:

### 1. Image Comparison Model

This model compares user-uploaded images with product images to find matching products. It utilizes techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract features from images and match them with stored product images.

### 2. Image Labeling/Tagging Model

The image labeling/tagging model converts user images into textual labels and tags. These labels and tags are used to search for products with similar characteristics. It employs natural language processing and computer vision techniques to perform this transformation.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or use it as a template for your own project.
2. Customize the `project/` folder with your project name and code.
3. Add more tests under the `tests/` folder.
4. Modify the `setup.py` file with your project's information for packaging.
5. Implement the image comparison and labeling/tagging models based on your requirements.
